# What is RadVac?
RadVac is the Linux of vaccines.  It's open-source, safe, and easy to make.  It contains only 5 ingredients (2 of which are water and salt), and is a nasal spray (so no needles, and no special training to administer).

You can get a basic overview via the ["About RadVac"](./about_radvac.md) document.  If you want all the nitty-gritty details, there's a 90-page white paper at https://radvac.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/White-Paper-SARS-CoV-2-vaccine-ver-4-1-2.pdf
