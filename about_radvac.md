# What is RaDVaC?
RaDVaC is an open-source vaccine that anyone can make.  It is designed by a team of researchers connected to Harvard Medical School.  There is a great deal of information on their website, radvac.org, written primarily for other scientists.  This document covers basic information for the general public.

# How does RaDVaC work?

RaDVaC is built on 3 well-established technologies:
  - nasal delivery 
    - which provides immunity where the virus enters/leaves the body
  - chitosan nanoparticles
    - which stimulate the immune system to fight an invader
  - lab-grown protein fragments
    - which tell the immune system which invader to fight

Each of these technologies has been used safely for many years - RaDVaC is primarily a method of combining them. The method for combining the technologies uses simple techniques that are possible for anyone with basic laboratory skills.  

Here is what each of the components do:

### Nasal delivery
This just means spraying the virus directly into the nose (allergy sprays, and some flu vaccines use the same approach).  Since no needles or injections are required, the virus can be administered by anyone.  Nasal delivery also means that the system-wide immune response isn't as strong as with an injection.  This makes the vaccine safer, but also means that it needs to be taken 3 or 4 times (instead of just 1 or 2 injections).

### Chitosan nanoparticles
The chitosan nanoparticles serve two purposes.  The first is as a transport system, which brings the protein fragments into the body.  Because the nanoparticles are about the same size as the COVID virus, they travel to the same parts of the nasal tissues, bringing the protein fragments with them.  The nanoparticles also help keep the protein fragments in place long enough for the body to respond.  

The second purpose of chitosan is as an "adjuvant", something which stimulates the immune system, telling the body that it needs to fight an invader.  Chitosan has been used in clinical trials, and found safe enough that the EU has recommended it for use as an adjuvant in vaccines.

### Lab-grown protein fragments
Your body learns to recognize invading viruses based on the shape of the virus' outer protein shell.  So to teach the body what to fight, most COVID vaccines include small pieces of the virus' shell that are both distinct to the virus, and likely to be recognized by the immune system.  These small pieces of protein are called "peptides".  The world is full of peptides that we eat and breathe every day, without any problem since peptides themselves are generally harmless. They are made in the cells of plants and animals, and can’t reproduce.  It is only when a peptide is combined with an adjuvant that the body learns to attack.

One difference between the various COVID vaccines is how they introduce those peptides into the body.  The Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca vaccines all trick the body into making these peptides.  RaDVaC is a little bit different; it uses peptides that are made in a lab, and delivers them directly to the body (similar to the Novavax vaccine).  While the delivery methods differ, the core principle is the same - the combination of an adjuvant and the peptides teach the body what to attack.

The choice of which peptides to use is one of the most important parts of any vaccine. Scientists make the decision based on several factors about peptides, including which peptides:
  - can be dissolved in water
    - so they can be delivered to the body
  - can be recognized by the immune system
    - so the body can learn what to attack
  - are unique to the virus
    - so the body doesn’t become sensitive to anything besides the virus
  - are likely to remain unchanged as the virus mutates
    - so that the immunity is long-lasting

# How safe is RaDVaC?
We believe that RaDVaCis very, very safe.  Chitosan has been used in clinical trials, and has an excellent safety record.  Nasal delivery is a well-established, safe delivery method which has the additional benefit of focussing the immune response in the mucus membranes of the nose and sinuses. This means that the worst side effect is typically just a stuffy nose, or in a few cases a mild headache.

The scientists at RaDVaC have taken care to choose the peptides safely as well.  They have compared the peptide sequences against the entire human genome (using BLAST), to be sure that the peptides used won't be mistaken for some part of the body.

Possibly the best indication of its safety: all of the RaDVaC team has not only taken it themselves, they've also provided it to their families.

# How effective is RaDVaC?
We're not sure.  There are good theoretical reasons to believe that  RaDVaC provides protection at the mucus membranes in the nasal area.  This helps do two things:
prevent you from acquiring COVID (because the virus enters the body by breathing in)
prevent you from spreading COVID (because you breath out virus growing in the nose)

Unfortunately, testing for this localized immune response is difficult.  Some RaDVaCers with the necessary equipment have done so, and reported signs of local immunity, as expected.

The other difficulty in evaluating efficacy is that RaDVaC stimulates a different part of the immune system from most vaccines. The part of the immune system activated is determined primarily by the adjuvant; RaDVaC uses chitosan, which primarily activates T-cells.  Most other vaccines instead primarily activate B-cells.  B-cells work by identifying invading viruses, and then recruit other parts of the immune system to attack.  It is easy to test for B-cell activation, because they produce antibodies which circulate in the blood. T-cells, in contrast, don't directly attack the virus; instead they attack your own cells if they have been taken over by the virus.  This makes T-cell response much harder to evaluate.

# Why hasn't RaDVaC been used before?
All of the individual components of RaDVaC have been used before.  What's new is the way they're put together.

Nasal-delivery vaccines are widely used in lab and experimental settings.  They are not commonly used for general vaccines, though, because they typically require multiple doses in order to build an immune response.  One notable exception is the nasal flu vaccine.  We can get away with a weak immune response in this case because basically everyone has had the flu before, so the body already has defenses against it... we just need to teach it about the new variants.

However, there are several challenges to using a nasal vaccine, including the RaDVac, at scale.  In rich/developed countries, time is at a premium, and it's difficult to get people to come to a doctor's office FOUR TIMES in order to complete a vaccination.  In developing countries, on the other hand, time carries less cost, so multiple doses are less onerous.

Another challenge is the short shelf life of RaDVaC (around two weeks).  This is fine for use in a laboratory setting, but is not very effective at industrial scales (where it's better to have a shelf life measured in years).  Partly because the shelf life is so short, RaDVaC is a labor-intensive option (as opposed to most commercial vaccines, which are capital-intensive).  It needs to be made in relatively small batches, for use shortly after creation.  This is not affordable for rich countries, but much more of an option in developing countries.

# How does  RaDVaC interact with the commercial vaccines?
You can and should take a commercial vaccine as soon as you are able to.  

You can also take RaDVac, as there should be no negative interactions between them. RaDVaC recruits a different part of the immune system than commercial vaccines (T-cells, as opposed to B-cells), so it is a complement, not a substitute.  It will provide additional protection to you and your family that you can't get from commercial vaccines, so you should still take both.
